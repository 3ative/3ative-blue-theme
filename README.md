## Installation

* Find your homeassistant directory containing your configuration (let's say `/config/`)
* Change into `/config/themes` (create the `themes` directory, if it does not exist, you then might have to restart HA)
* Ensure HA knows your new theme file - add this to your `configuration.yaml`
``` yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```
* Copy the https://github.com/3ative/3ative-blue-theme/blob/master/3ative_bg.jpg to your ***config/www/** folder
* Finally enable the theme from your profile page or `configuration.yaml`
